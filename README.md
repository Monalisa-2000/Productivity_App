# Abstract
Nowadays, there is large population which is suffering from smart phone addiction, especially in college and school students. So now the smart phone addiction can be seen differently from the Internet addiction. In this project we have tried to control the addiction of the people. Firstly, we are doing the analysis in the user’s phone, then we find whether the user is addicted to certain apps or not, then we generate the report. Afterwards as per report an application designed for the betterment of user to avoid inconsistency occur by social media platforms while they are accessing it. It is an android based application that is coded in Java and PHP language with the help of Android Studio. Here, the user gets notification on the home screen when the handset connects to network i.e. cellular data or Wi-Fi network. Afterwards a box will be pop-up where the user try to click on the notification of any particular selected app displayed on the locked screen where it shows the” Go Back “option to the user and that locks it to give the reply to the sender to continue their work to maintain consistency.
